# Unofficial Minecraft Forge documentation

This repo was born out of frustration of the dumpster fire that is Minecraft
Forge documentation. I wrote it for myself as both a quick reference for
creating new Minecraft mods and documentation to explain things.

Use [MkDocs] to build this documentation.
